<h1> The Community Garden </h>
<h2> Where sustainibility meets home </h2>
<p> Reason for this: Many marginalized communities have limited access to fresh produce. 
  When looking in suburban areas as opposed to areas with more individuals of color. 
  This website would provide access to a community that is willing to help care for and build community gardens across the United States. 
  Our website will include a live chat and a starter page on how to build a community garden. 
  We will connect with local grocery stores to help provide seeds and items for starter kits. </p>
